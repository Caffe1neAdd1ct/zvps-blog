        <h3>How did we start?</h3>
        
        <p>
            In 2012 we opened for business, primarily helping local businesses with their local IT support. 
            Our support services include everything from desktop support to office network wiring.
        </p>

        <h4>ZPanel and Open Source Support</h4>
        
        <p>
            In April of 2012 we implemented zVPS, a virtual server provider with the sole goal to support ZPanelCP. 
            Any profits made are put towards supporting the Open Source project by providing free servers and infrastructure support. 
            We aim to provide pre-installed ZPanelCP servers for anyone without any additional charges.

        <h5>What's important?</h5>
        
        <p>
            Our company prides itself in providing good value services backed by fantastic support. 
            We like to know our customers, know their requirements and help to fulfil our role as a reliable service provider.
        </p>

        <h6>Looking ahead...</h6>
        
        <p>
            We are gradually expanding our virtual server offerings with additional features such as DDoS protection and anti-spam blocking. 
            These help to provide a reliable service for all our new and existing customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our development team is also very busy working on our bespoke server management panel to give our customers full control over their servers, billing and other essential features.
            From our management panel currently customers can perform reboots, update PTR records and console into their virtual servers.
